I've analyzed my own WGS too like 7 years ago. I've run a bunch of analysis and annotation tools and I don't even remember all of them.
 Looking at the .sh scripts I've saved, I've run GATK, DeepVariant, Manta, MetaSV, Canvas,
 Nirvana, AKT, and have annotated with HGMD and SnpSift/SnpEff. Aligned with both NovoAlign and BWA MEM using
 both GRCh37 and GRCh38 after trimming with AlienTrimmer and Trimmomatic. I even aligned it with the T2T_CHM13_v2 but there is
 little clinical annotation available for that so nothing much was annotated against this assembly.
A couple of years ago, I additionally analyzed it through SMNCopyNumberCaller.
